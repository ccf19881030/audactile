Audactile
---------

Audactile is my current personal project of create a media player
with a small, but good set of features. I just want to merge the
best features I've found in another media players and cut the crap
off.

Some cool guidelines:

- Simple is good.
- Features are good, since they keep Audactile simple.
- There are too much iTunes clones.
- Amarok 1.x, I miss you.
- I don't know if I need menubars. Old Winamp/XMMS, I miss you too.
- Stability is good.
